# dotfiles

These are config files for applications that I use.

- `.config` is a directory recognized by certain applications in your home directory (`$HOME`) and for the ones that do, I have the directories configured.
- `my_configs.vim` is my customization for vim.
- `tmux.conf` is my customization for tmux using another library.
